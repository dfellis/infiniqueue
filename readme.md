# Infiniqueue

[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/infiniqueue.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/infiniqueue) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/dfellis/infiniqueue.png)](http://travis-ci.org/dfellis/infiniqueue) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/dfellis/infiniqueue.png)](https://gemnasium.com/dfellis/infiniqueue) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/dfellis/infiniqueue/badge.png?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/dfellis/infiniqueue?branch=master)

Simple synchronous queue to get around V8 issue with very large arrays as queues.

[Beware using JS Arrays as FIFO queues when your queue exceeds over 100k items](https://gist.github.com/dfellis/5986471) Infiniqueue is here to help!

## Quick install instructions

For Node.js

    npm install infiniqueue

For browsers, just copy ``./lib/infiniqueue.min.js`` (generated by [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/))and include it in a ``<script>`` tag. Don't have browserling results on the readme, yet, since browserling times out the tests before they finish on most browsers.

For developers, ``npm test`` to check your changes (using [nodeunit](https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit/)) haven't broken existing functionality.

## Usage

```js
var Infiniqueue = require('infiniqueue');

var queue = new Infiniqueue();
queue.enqueue('some value');
console.log(queue.length); // 1
queue.dequeue(); // 'some value'
queue.shutdown(function() { console.log('done'); });
```
