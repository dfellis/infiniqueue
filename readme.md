# InfiniQueue

Simple synchronous queue to get around V8 issue with very large arrays as queues.

[Beware using JS Arrays as FIFO queues when your queue exceeds over 100k items](https://gist.github.com/dfellis/5986471) InfiniQueue is here to help!

## Quick install instructions

For Node.js

    npm install infiniqueue

For browsers, just copy ``./lib/infiniqueue.min.js`` (generated by [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS/))and include it in a ``<script>`` tag.

For developers, ``npm test`` to check your changes (using [nodeunit](https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit/)) haven't broken existing functionality.

## Usage

```js
var InfiniQueue = require('infiniqueue');

var queue = new InfiniQueue();
queue.enqueue('some value');
console.log(queue.length); // 1
queue.dequeue(); // 'some value'
queue.shutdown(function() { console.log('done'); });
```
